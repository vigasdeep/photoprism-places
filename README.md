Note that this is work in progress. We are happy to assist other OSS projects that don't have the time or expertise to run their own infrastructure.

## Example Request ## 

https://places.photoprism.org/v1/location/149ce78563

```json
{
  "id":"149ce78563",
  "name":"Pink Beach",
  "category":"nature",
  "timezone":"Europe/Athens",
  "lat":35.26963621850717,
  "lng":23.53695076231683,
  "place": {
    "id":"149ce78563",
    "label":"Chrisoskalitissa, Crete, Greece",
    "city":"Chrisoskalitissa",
    "state":"Crete",
    "country":"gr"
  },
  "events":[],
  "licence":"Data Â© OpenStreetMap contributors"
}
```

## Privacy ##

Geocoding requests are NOT logged, but developers can of course see cached items in MariaDB without personal information. That's the point of a cache. Those will be randomly distributed with hot spots around tourist attractions and big cities.

Because of HTTPS, your internet provider can't see the exact request, just that you contacted a server.

The API approximates coordinates, encodes them with S2 and doesn't care about street or house number:

## Performance ##

First [benchmarks](https://github.com/tsliwowicz/go-wrk) show that up to 2500 req/s can be handled. Compare this with the pricing of commercial providers and you'll see the value.

If you prefer running this on-site: We use a 6-core Intel Xeon processor, 320 GB of SSD and 16 GB of memory. 
In addition you'll have to download ~100 GB of data.
Due to the properties of S2 cell IDs, scaling and sharding should be easy if needed.

## Disclaimer ##

We'd like to remind everyone that we are no full-time marketing specialists but developers who work a lot and 
enjoy a bit of sarcasm from time to time. Please let us know when there is an issue with our "nuance and tone" 
and we'll find a solution.
